# GdxGameSkeleton
A simple game skeleton for libGDx to start with. Supports different screens including menu and loading screens, loading via AssetManager and scalable viewport for Menu and loading. GameScreen has to be implemented.

# Why?
Because at the last game jam, it was so annoying not to have such a skeleton.
